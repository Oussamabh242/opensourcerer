# Hello there!

## Do you want to inquire about why this website named like that or you would like to know who am I ?

### Oh yeah... I forgot that this is not interactive so I guess I will be the one choosing 
## I will be talking about the idea of the website `what is it ?` && `why is it ?` && `how is it ?` and if you want to find out about me feel free to visit the [About Section](/about )


# The What ! Or should I call it the ***Manifesto***

* This is a website of an amateur Human Being who likes to yap about various things especially Programming, People(not "gossip" but rather behavior), Casual thoughts that hit you when you are taking a shower... *I guess this is what i remember for now if I have any thing else I will add it to the topics*.

* It wont be AI generated just my pure improvisation, clearly the world had enough of these.

* It wont be like LinkedIn Where every thing is a leadership lesson... *Oh Actually this can be a good post I guess I wont continue this section for the time being it will be turned into a post*.

# The Why ! Think i should call it the ***Ontology*** 

* ## Reason

No particular Reason Just want to post my Ideas and takes about things somewhere safe, far from the control of social media algorithms 
With no comments I don't like people to make reaction `Insightful` and write in the comment section `very informative`. 

* ## Name 

Am I the only one who finds the name `Open Sourcerer` to be cool! Doesn't matter.
The name is a mix between `Open source` && `Sorcerer`, you can think of it as a wizard who gives open source stuff, because everything in here is open source.

Oh yeah, and the blog code is here [in my gh repo](https://github.com/Oussamabh242/opensourcerer ).

* ## Website

Design Does not matter it is readable, I like the color it is my favorite and actually this is a custom modded template for `Hugo` (a static site generator) 
and hosted on github pages.
