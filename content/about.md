Hi, I am Oussama Ben Hassen I am a 22yo mostly a `wonderer` and a `coder`,

I dont like to put a label on me (coding wise) front or back or systems I do evrery thing that tikles my mind, 

sorry if I dirft sometimes you will get used to it or to me or whatever, where were we? , oh yes we where about the coding part.

yes I like coding, it tickles my mind.

I mostly enjoy writing things that talk to hardware like system engeneering, I also like to make fast and smooth error prone backends, I try to build good frontends ( I fail most of the time) but i keep trying, I try to make enjoyable games, I try to have an easy devlopper environment, 

Would you like to know what I use as languages and tools, Okay

* Progarmming Languages

    - My favourite one is `Golang`  <span class="nerd-icon">î˜§</span> 
    - My second favourite is `TypeScript`
    - I like low level programming with the holly `C`
    - Also enjoy `Python`, `Lua`, `Bash` , `Sql`

* OS and stuff
    - I am a `Linux` User I use `Void linux` as my distribution, it is reliable , uptodate, and lightweight
    - For my code editor I use guess what ... yes you are right `Neovim btw` 

I Think a lot I ask alot and I try to find answers, 

Actually I don't like to talk about myself alot, but you might see this website and ask your self "how the hell doesn't he like to talk about him self and make a full website to share his thing" yeah i guess you are right or maybe not I don't know, I feel like I didn't talk alot about myself but then I see how much `I's` I have written and tell myself I guess I am egotestical. ***huhh! wont try to write any more about myself so you dont see me as an egotestical***
